Our algorithm will generate an emulation using vertex disjoint subgraph homeomorphism. To do this, we model both the virtual and concrete FPGA as vertex-multilabeled directed graphs as defined in Definition \ref{def:graph}. This section specifies this process.

In short, we model each logic cell and each wire and transistor that are not part of a logic cell as vertices, and add an extra vertex for each input- and output of logic cells. The edges between the vertices denote either the direction of a transistor (if connecting a transistor and a wire) or the data flow of a logic cell (if connecting a wire with an in/output or an in/output with a logic cell).

We label each wire vertex with the label \texttt{WIRE}, each transistor with the label \texttt{ARC}, each logic cell with the label \texttt{SLICE} and each in/output with the label \texttt{PORT}. Furthermore, we add the label \texttt{CE} to an input that enables writing data to the register of the logic cell. Lastly, we add the label \texttt{UNCONFIGURABLE} to transistors that are always enabled and not configurable by the FPGA configurator. We use these labels to to avoid unintended electrical current flow between parts in the concrete FPGA.
