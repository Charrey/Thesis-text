\caption{Performance of our algorithm $\mathit{RTSH}$ using the configurations that individually perform best: DFS path iteration, avoiding unnecessarily long paths and N-reachability AllDifferent pruning. Contraction is disabled. We use 10 minutes worth of tests for each data point and stop testing when that is not enough for finding a homeomorphism in a single test case.}
