\begin{enumerate}
\item concurrent tree exploration
\item concurrent tree with different threads using different limits.
\item Backmarking and backjumping
\item choose target graph vertices based on some location heuristic, e.g. tiles
\item use hierachy: e.g. when a component has been matched with some pattern Q, immediately match the next component with an isomorphic pattern Q', allowing for backtracking
\item pruning does not take contracted vertices into account
\item multigraph introduces repetition, remove it


\end{enumerate}
