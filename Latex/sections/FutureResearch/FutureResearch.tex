\begin{enumerate}
\item concurrent tree exploration
\item Backmarking and backjumping
\item choose target graph vertices based on some location heuristic, e.g. tiles
\item use hierachy: e.g. when a component has been matched with some pattern Q, immediately match the next component with an isomorphic pattern Q', allowing for backtracking
\end{enumerate}
