Developing effective and efficient subgraph match methods over these graphs is urgent, meaningful and necessary. Although some excellent exploratory approaches have been proposed these years, they show poor performances when the graphs are large and dense. This paper presents a novel Subgraph Query technique Based on Clique feature, called SQBC, which integrates the carefully designed clique encoding with the existing vertex encoding [40] as the basic index unit to reduce the search space. Furthermore, SQBC optimizes the subgraph isomorphism test based on clique features. Extensive experiments over biological networks, RDF dataset and synthetic graphs have shown that SQBC outperforms the most popular competitors both in effectiveness and efficiency especially when the data graphs are large and dense. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The experimental results on benchmark graphs demonstrate that the new pruning method is competitive w.r.t. recently proposed techniques. Significantly better results are obtained on sparse graphs.

One of the fundamental problems in graph databases is efficient search and retrieval of graphs using indexing techniques. In this paper, we study the problem of indexing graph databases using frequent subtrees as indexing structures. Trees can be manipulated efficiently while preserving a lot of structural information of the original graphs. In our proposed method, frequent subtrees of a database are selected as the feature set. To save memory, the set of feature trees is shrunk based on a support threshold function and their discriminative power. A treepartition based query processing scheme is proposed to perform graph queries. The concept of Center Distance Constraints is introduced to prune the search space. Furthermore, a new algorithm which utilizes the location information of indexing structures is used to perform subgraph isomorphism tests. We apply our method on a wide range of real and synthetic data to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this approach. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Graphs are prevalently used to model the relationships between objects in various domains. With the increasing usage of graph databases, it has become more and more demanding to efficiently process graph queries. Querying graph databases is costly since it involves subgraph isomorphism testing, which is an NP-complete problem. In recent years, some effective graph indexes have been proposed to first obtain a candidate answer set by filtering part of the false results and then perform verification on each candidate by checking subgraph isomorphism. Query performance is improved since the number of subgraph isomorphism tests is reduced. However, candidate verification is still inevitable, which can be expensive when the size of the candidate answer set is large. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing technique that constructs a nested inverted-index, called FG-index, based on the set of Frequent subGraphs (FGs). Given a graph query that is an FG in the database, FG-index returns the exact set of query answers without performing candidate verification. When the query is an infrequent graph, FG-index produces a candidate answer set which is close to the exact answer set. Since an infrequent graph means the graph occurs in only a small number of graphs in the database, the number of subgraph isomorphism tests is small. To ensure that the index fits into the main memory, we propose a new notion of -Tolerance Closed Frequent Graphs (-TCFGs), which allows us to flexibly tune the size of the index in a parameterized way. Our extensive experiments verify that query processing using FG-index is orders of magnitude more efficient than using the state-of-the-art graph index. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {Copyright 2007 VLDB Endowment, ACM. Recent scientific and technological advances have witnessed an abundance of structural patterns modeled as graphs. As a result, it is of special interest to process graph containment queries effectively on large graph databases. Given a graph database G, and a query graph q, the graph containment query is to retrieve all graphs in G which contain q as subgraph(s). Due to the vast number of graphs in G and the nature of complexity for subgraph isomorphism testing, it is desirable to make use of high-quality graph indexing mechanisms to reduce the overall query processing cost. In this paper, we propose a new cost-effective graph indexing method based on frequent tree-features of the graph database. We analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of tree as indexing feature from three critical aspects: feature size, feature selection cost, and pruning power. In order to achieve better pruning ability than existing graph-based indexing methods, we select, in addition to frequent tree-features (Tree), a small number of discriminative graphs ($\Delta$) on demand, without a costly graph mining process beforehand. Our study verifies that (Tree+$\Delta$) is a better choice than graph for indexing purpose, denoted (Tree+$\Delta$ ≥Graph), to address the graph containment query problem. It has two implications: (1) the index construction by (Tree+$\Delta$) is efficient, and (2) the graph containment query processing by (Tree+$\Delta$) is efficient. Our experimental studies demonstrate that (Tree+$\Delta$) has a compact index structure, achieves an order of magnitude better performance in index construction, and most importantly, outperforms up-to-date graph-based indexing methods: gIndex and C-Tree, in graph containment query processing.},

abstract = {Retrieving related graphs containing a query graph from a large graph database is a key issue in many graph-based applications, such as drug discovery and structural pattern recognition. Because sub-graph isomorphism is a NP-complete problem [4], we have to employ a filter-and-verification framework to speed up the search efficiency, that is, using an effective and efficient pruning strategy to filter out the false positives (graphs that are not possible in the results) as many as possible first, then validating the remaining candidates by subgraph isomorphism checking. In this paper, we propose a novel filtering method, a spectral encoding method, i.e. GCoding. Specifically, we assign a signature to each vertex based on its local structures. Then, we generate a spectral graph code by combining all vertex signatures in a graph. Based on spectral graph codes, we derive a necessary condition for sub-graph isomorphism. Then we propose two pruning rules for sub-graph search problem, and prove that they satisfy the no-false-negative requirement (no dismissal in answers). Since graph codes are in numerical space, we take this advantage and conduct efficient filtering over graph codes. Extensive experiments show that GCoding outperforms existing counterpart methods.

We propose a query language for graph databases that supports arbitrary attributes on nodes, edges, and graphs. In this language, graphs are the basic unit of information and each query manipulates one or more collections of graphs. To allow for flexible compositions of graph structures, we extend the notion of formal languages from strings to the graph domain. We present a graph algebra extended from the relational algebra in which the selection operator is generalized to graph pattern matching and a composition operator is introduced for rewriting matched graphs. Then, we investigate access methods of the selection operator. Pattern matching over large graphs is challenging due to the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism. We address this by a combination of techniques: use of neighborhood subgraphs and profiles, joint reduction of the search space, and optimization of the search order. Experimental results on real and synthetic large graphs demonstrate that our graph specific optimizations outperform an SQL-based implementation by orders of magnitude. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

In this paper, we aim to develop efficient techniques to retrieve graphs, containing a given query graph, from a large set of graphs. Considering the problem of testing subgraph isomorphism is generally NP-hard, most of the existing techniques are based on the framework of filtering-and-verification to reduce the precise computation costs; consequently various novel feature-based indexes have been developed. While the existing techniques work well for small query graphs, the verification phase becomes a bottleneck when the query graph size increases. Motivated by this, in the paper we firstly propose a novel and efficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism, QuickSI. Secondly, we develop a new feature-based index technique to accommodate QuickSI in the filtering phase. Our extensive experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed techniques, which significantly improve the existing techniques. {\textcopyright} 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

The main challenge is size. Each graph may contain thousands (or more) vertices. Most of the previous work focuses on indexing a set of small or medium sized database graphs (with only tens of vertices) and finding whether a query graph occurs in any of these. In this paper, we are interested in finding all the matches of a query graph in a given large graph of thousands of vertices, which is a very important task in many biological applications. This increases the complexity significantly. We propose a novel distance measurement which reintroduces the idea of frequent substructures in a single large graph. We devise the novel structure distance based approach (GADDI) to efficiently find matches of the query graph. GADDI is further optimized by the use of a dynamic matching scheme to minimize redundant calculations. Last but not least, a number of real and synthetic data sets are used to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed method. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract = {Background: Finding the subgraphs of a graph database that are isomorphic to a given query graph has practical applications in several fields, from cheminformatics to image understanding. Since subgraph isomorphism is a computationally hard problem, indexing techniques have been intensively exploited to speed up the process. Such systems filter out those graphs which cannot contain the query, and apply a subgraph isomorphism algorithm to each residual candidate graph. The applicability of such systems is limited to databases of small graphs, because their filtering power degrades on large graphs.Results: In this paper, SING (Subgraph search In Non-homogeneous Graphs), a novel indexing system able to cope with large graphs, is presented. The method uses the notion of feature, which can be a small subgraph, subtree or path. Each graph in the database is annotated with the set of all its features. The key point is to make use of feature locality information. This idea is used to both improve the filtering performance and speed up the subgraph isomorphism task.Conclusions: Extensive tests on chemical compounds, biological networks and synthetic graphs show that the proposed system outperforms the most popular systems in query time over databases of medium and large graphs. Other specific tests show that the proposed system is effective for single large graphs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Di Natale et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Unfortunately, subgraph matching is NP-complete, making its application to massive SNs a major challenge. Past work has shown how to implement subgraph matching on a single processor when the graph has 10-25M edges. In this paper, we show how to use cloud computing in conjunction with such existing single processor methods to efficiently match complex subgraphs on graphs as large as 778M edges. A cloud consists of one "master" compute node and $\kappa$ "slave" compute nodes. We first develop a probabilistic method to estimate probabilities that a vertex will be retrieved by a random query and that a pair of vertices will be successively retrieved by a random query. We use these probability estimates to define edge weights in an SN and to compute minimal edge cuts to partition the graph amongst $\kappa$ slave nodes. We develop algorithms for both master and slave nodes that try to minimize communication overhead. The resulting COSI system can answer complex queries over real-world SN data containing over 778M edges very efficiently. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The dramatic proliferation of sophisticated networks has re- sulted in a growing need for supporting effective querying and mining methods over such large-scale graph-structured data. At the core of many advanced network operations lies a common and critical graph query primitive: how to search graph structures efficiently within a large network? Unfortunately, the graph query is hard due to the NP-complete nature of subgraph isomorphism. It becomes even challenging when the network examined is large and diverse. In this paper, we present a high performance graph indexing mechanism, SPath, to address the graph query problem on large networks. SPath leverages decomposed shortest paths around vertex neighborhood as basic indexing units, which prove to be both effective in graph search space pruning and highly scalable in index construction and deployment. Via SPath, a graph query is processed and optimized beyond the traditional vertex-at-a-time fashion to a more efficient path-at-a-time way: the query is first decomposed to a set of shortest paths, among which a subset of candidates with good selectivity is picked by a query plan optimizer; Candidate paths are further joined together to help recover the query graph to finalize the graph query processing. We evaluate SPath with the state-of-the-art GraphQL on both real and synthetic data sets. Our experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SPath, which proves to be a more practical and efficient indexing method in addressing graph queries on large networks. {\textcopyright} 2010 VLDB Endowment.},

Subgraph isomorphism is a common problem in several application fields where graphs are the best suited data representation, but it is known to be an NP-Complete problem. However, several algorithms exist that are fast enough on commonly encountered graphs so as to be practically usable; among them, for more than a decade VF2 has been the state of the art algorithm used to solve this problem and it is still the reference algorithm for many applications. Nevertheless, VF2 has been designed and implemented ten years ago when the structural features of the commonly used graphs were considerably different. Hence a renovation is required to make the algorithm able to compete in the challenges arisen in the last years, such as the use of graph matching on the very large graphs coming from bioinformatics applications. In this paper we propose a significant set of enhancements to the original VF2 algorithm that enable it to compete with more recently proposed graph matching techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of these enhancement by comparing the matching performance both with the original VF2 and with several recent algorithms, using both the widely known MIVIA graph database and another public graph dataset containing real-world graphs from bioinformatics applications.},

This partial order over labels is used to filter domains. Labelings can also be strengthened by adding information from the labels of neighbors.

A solution to a binary constraint satisfaction problem is a set of discrete values, one in each of a given set of domains, subject to constraints that allow only prescribed pairs of values in specified pairs of domains. Solutions are sought by backtrack search interleaved with a process that removes from domains those values that are currently inconsistent with provisional choices already made in the course of search. For each value in a given domain, a bit-vector shows which values in another domain are or are not permitted in a solution. Bit-vector representation of constraints allows bit-parallel, therefore fast, operations for editing domains during search. This article revises and updates bit-vector algorithms published in the 1970's, and introduces focus search, which is a new bit-vector algorithm relying more on search and less on domain-editing than previous algorithms. Focus search is competitive within a limited family of constraint satisfaction problems. Determination of subgraph isomorphism is a specialized binary constraint satisfaction problem for which bit-vector algorithms have been widely used since the 1980s, particularly for matching molecular structures. This article very substantially updates the author's 1976 subgraph isomorphism algorithm, and reports experimental results with random and real-life data.},

The common aim of existing algorithms is to eliminate unsuccessful mappings as early as and as inexpensively as possible.Results: We propose a new subgraph isomorphism algorithm which applies a search strategy to significantly reduce the search space without using any complex pruning rules or domain reduction procedures.

While this problem belongs to NP-hard, many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets. However, a recent study has shown, through an extensive benchmark with various real datasets, that all existing algorithms have serious problems in their matching order selection. Furthermore, all algorithms blindly permutate all possible mappings for query vertices, often leading to useless computations. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust subgraph search solution, called Turbo ISO, which is turbo-charged with two novel concepts, candidate region exploration and the combine and permute strategy (in short, COMB/PERM). The candidate region exploration identifies on-the-fly candidate subgraphs (i.e, candidate regions), which contain embeddings, and computes a robust matching order for each candidate region explored. The COMB/PERM strategy exploits the novel concept of the neighborhood equivalence class (NEC). Each query vertex in the same NEC has identically matching data vertices. During subgraph isomorphism search, COMB/PERM generates only combinations for each NEC instead of permutating all possible enumerations. Thus, if a chosen combination is determined to not contribute to a complete solution, all possible permutations for that combination will be safely pruned. Extensive experiments with many real datasets show that Turbo ISO consistently and significantly outperforms all competitors by up to several orders of magnitude.

The sub graph isomorphism search is concerned with finding all sub graphs that are isomorphic to a relevant query graph, the existence of such sub graphs can reflect on the characteristics of the modeled system. The most computationally expensive step in the search for isomorphic sub graphs is the backtracking algorithm that traverses the nodes of the target graph.

Nevertheless, VF2 has been designed and implemented ten years ago when the structural features of the commonly used graphs were considerably different. Hence a renovation is required to make the algorithm able to compete in the challenges arisen in the last years, such as the use of graph matching on the very large graphs coming from bioinformatics applications. In this paper we propose a significant set of enhancements to the original VF2 algorithm that enable it to compete with more recently proposed graph matching techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of these enhancement by comparing the matching performance both with the original VF2 and with several recent algorithms, using both the widely known MIVIA graph database and another public graph dataset containing real-world graphs from bioinformatics applications.},

@inproceedings{Bi2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM. In this paper, we study the problem of subgraph matching that extracts all subgraph isomorphic embeddings of a query graph q in a large data graph G. The existing algorithms for subgraph matching follow Ullmann's backtracking approach; that is, iteratively map query vertices to data vertices by following a matching order of query vertices. It has been shown that the matching order of query vertices is a very important aspect to the efficiency of a subgraph matching algorithm. Recently, many advanced techniques, such as enforcing connectivity and merging similar vertices in query or data graphs, have been proposed to provide an effective matching order with the aim to reduce unpromising intermediate results especially the ones caused by redundant Cartesian products. In this paper, for the first time we address the issue of unpromising results by Cartesian products from "dissimilar" vertices. We propose a new framework by postponing the Cartesian products based on the structure of a query to minimize the redundant Cartesian products. Our second contribution is proposing a new path-based auxiliary data structure, with the size O(|E(G)| × |V(q)|), to generate a matching order and conduct subgraph matching, which significantly reduces the exponential size O(|V(G)||V(q)|-1) of the existing path-based auxiliary data structure, where V(G) and E(G) are the vertex and edge sets of a data graph G, respectively, and V(q) is the vertex set of a query q. Extensive empirical studies on real and synthetic graphs demonstrate that our techniques outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 3 orders of magnitude.},

Subgraph isomorphism is a computationally challenging problem with important practical applications, for example in computer vision, biochemistry, and model checking. There are a number of stateof- the-art algorithms for solving the problem, each of which has its own performance characteristics. As with many other hard problems, the single best choice of algorithm overall is rarely the best algorithm on an instance-by-instance. We develop an algorithm selection approach which leverages novel features to characterise subgraph isomorphism problems and dynamically decides which algorithm to use on a per-instance basis. We demonstrate substantial performance improvements on a large set of hard benchmark problems. In addition, we show how algorithm selection models can be leveraged to gain new insights into what affects the performance of an algorithm.},

The tremendous explosion of Big Data such as social network data has made it urgent to mine important information embedded in the huge graphs. One of the mining tasks is to discover the most frequent graph in a large graph. This task is equivalently to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is to discover the subgraph of a large graph that is isomporphic to a small input graph. The subgraph isomorphism problem is inherently a NP-hard problem, thus an exact algorithm is impossible when graphs are huge, which are the cases these days. In this study, we reported the implementation of three heuristic optimization algorithms: simulated annealing (SA), (1+1) evolutionary algorithm, and genetic algorithm (GA). We applied these algorithms on randomly generated graphs for identifying the isomorphic subgraphs, and compared the performance of these three algorithms. Our experimental results have shown that GA performed better than the other two algorithms overall.},

Applications to analyze them require to apply solutions for the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete.

We focus on two recent solutions, which are based on an effective variable ordering strategy.

@inproceedings{Xie2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Recently, subgraph matching has been implemented in more and more domains, such as social network and semantic web. An approximated solution for subgraph matching named strong simulation has been put forward. Strong Simulation can preserve the topology of data graphs and find a bounded number of matches, but the complexity further holds a cubic-time, so it's yet intractable to deal with large graphs. To solve the problem, this paper focuses on a partition scheme to reduce the search space of subgraph matching algorithm. Firstly, we present a pruning method on data graph based on the connection relationships of nodes and edges in query graph. Secondly, we propose to use a multilevel partitioning algorithm when the subgraphs we get from former step are too large. Thirdly, we propose an algorithm for subgraph matching based on the partitioning scheme, which can preserve the topology of query graph and guarantee the correctness of results. Lastly, we experimentally prove the effectiveness and efficiency of this scheme, both using real-life data and synthetic data. It turns out that our method is quite efficient and the matching results are also satisfactory.},

Graph matching is essential in several fields that use structured information, such as biology, chemistry, social networks, knowledge management, document analysis and others.

In this paper we introduce a novel subgraph isomorphism algorithm, VF3, particularly efficient in the challenging case of graphs with thousands of nodes and a high edge density. Its performance, both in terms of time and memory, has been assessed on a large dataset of 12,700 random graphs with a size up to 10,000 nodes, made publicly available. VF3 has been compared with four other state-of-the-art algorithms, and the huge experimentation required more than two years of processing time. The results confirm that VF3 definitely outperforms the other algorithms when the graphs become huge and dense, but also has a very good performance on smaller or sparser graphs.},

We show that for several pattern graphs on four vertices (e.g., C4), their induced copies in host graphs with n vertices and no clique on k + 1 vertices can be deterministically detected in time {\~{O}} (n$\omega$k$\mu$ + n2k2), where {\~{O}} (f) stands for O(f(log f)c) for some constant c, and $\mu$ ≈ 0. 46530. The aforementioned pattern graphs have a pair of non-adjacent vertices whose neighborhoods are equal. By considering dual graphs, in the same asymptotic time, we can also detect four vertex pattern graphs, that have an adjacent pair of vertices with the same neighbors among the remaining vertices (e.g., K4), in host graphs with n vertices and no independent set on k + 1 vertices. By using the concept of Ramsey numbers, we can extend our method for induced subgraph isomorphism to include larger pattern graphs having a set of independent vertices with the same neighborhood and nvertex host graphs without cliques on k+1 vertices (as well as the pattern graphs and host graphs dual to the aforementioned ones, respectively).},

Specifically, we first extract some features, including some information of vertices, edges, the shortest paths and Laplacian spectra, and encode extracted features. An index PLGCode-Tree is built based on codes to shrink the candidate set. Then, we propose two-step filtering strategy to implement the filtering-and-verification framework and thus generate the answer set.

@inproceedings{Han2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Subgraph matching (or subgraph isomorphism) is one of the fundamental problems in graph analysis. Extensive research has been done to develop practical solutions for subgraph matching. The state-of-the-art algorithms such as CFL-Match and Turboiso convert a query graph into a spanning tree for obtaining candidates for each query vertex and obtaining a good matching order with the spanning tree. However, by using the spanning tree instead of the original query graph, it could lead to lower pruning power and a sub-optimal matching order. Another limitation is that they perform redundant computation in search without utilizing the knowledge learned from past computation. In this paper, we introduce three novel concepts to address these inherent limitations: 1) dynamic programming between a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a graph, 2) adaptive matching order with DAG ordering, and 3) pruning by failing sets, which together lead to a much faster algorithm DAF for subgraph matching. Extensive experiments with real datasets show that DAF outperforms the fastest existing solution by up to orders of magnitude in terms of recursive calls as well as in terms of the elapsed time.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. In different application fields, such as biology, databases, social networks and so on, graphs are a widely adopted structure to represent the data. In these fields, a relevant problem is the detection and the localization of structural patterns within very large graphs; such a problem, formalized as subgraph isomorphism, has been proven to be NP-Complete in the general case. Moreover, the continuously growing size of the graphs to face, actually of hundred thousands of nodes, is making the problem even more challenging also for the most efficient algorithms in the state of the art, requiring days or weeks of computational time. This huge amount of time is also consequence of the fact that most of the algorithms do not exploit any kind of parallelism, even if the problem is suitable to be solved adopting parallel approaches. In this paper we present a new parallel algorithm for subgraph isomorphism, namely VF3P, based on a redesign of the well known algorithm VF3. The effectiveness of VF3P has been experimentally proven on a publicly available dataset of very large graphs, confirming that the algorithm is able to efficiently scale w.r.t. the number of used CPUs without affecting the memory usage.},

@book{Malik2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. We consider the subgraph isomorphism problem where, given two graphs G (source graph) and F (pattern graph), one is to decide whether there is a (not necessarily induced) subgraph of G isomorphic to F. While many practical heuristic algorithms have been developed for the problem, as pointed out by McCreesh et al. [JAIR 2018], for each of them there are rather small instances which they cannot cope. Therefore, developing an alternative approach that could possibly cope with these hard instances would be of interest. A seminal paper by Alon, Yuster and Zwick [J. ACM 1995] introduced the color coding approach to solve the problem, where the main part is a dynamic programming over color subsets and partial mappings. As with many exponential-time dynamic programming algorithms, the memory requirements constitute the main limiting factor for its usage. Because these requirements grow exponentially with the treewidth of the pattern graph, all existing implementations based on the color coding principle restrict themselves to specific pattern graphs, e.g., paths or trees. In contrast, we provide an efficient implementation of the algorithm significantly reducing its memory requirements so that it can be used for pattern graphs of larger treewidth. Moreover, our implementation not only decides the existence of an isomorphic subgraph, but it also enumerates all such subgraphs (or given number of them). We provide an extensive experimental comparison of our implementation to other available solvers for the problem.},

abstract = "Recent progress in biology and computer science have generated many complicated networks, most of which can be modeled as large and dense graphs. Developing effective and efficient subgraph match methods over these graphs is urgent, meaningful and necessary. Although some excellent exploratory approaches have been proposed these years, they show poor performances when the graphs are large and dense. This paper presents a novel Subgraph Query technique Based on Clique feature, called SQBC, which integrates the carefully designed clique encoding with the existing vertex encoding [40] as the basic index unit to reduce the search space. Furthermore, SQBC optimizes the subgraph isomorphism test based on clique features. Extensive experiments over biological networks, RDF dataset and synthetic graphs have shown that SQBC outperforms the most popular competitors both in effectiveness and efficiency especially when the data graphs are large and dense."

The neurons are initialized based on the necessary conditions for subgraph isomorphism. The motion equation is solved using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method.

Simplified and streamlined arc consistency and tree search algorithms are introduced, and experimental results show substantial reduction in timings compared with previous algorithms for determining isomorphisms. Several path consistency algorithms, including a new one, have been timed experimentally on isomorphism problems, and found not to be cost effective despite their theoretical appeal. The importance of this result is enhanced by the absence of previously published experimentation with path consistency. A theoretical study of the new path consistency algorithm provides insight into the experimental results."

By decoupling the solution algorithm from the concrete graph model, this approach allows for variations of the model without affecting the algorithm. Furthermore, complementing the standard CSP definition, a query concept is introduced to allow for abstract representation of concrete implementation properties for optimization purposes.",

abstract = "The subgraph homeomorphism problem is to decide if there is an injective mapping of the vertices of a pattern graph into vertices of a host graph so that the edges of the pattern graph can be mapped into (internally) vertex-disjoint paths in the host graph. The restriction of subgraph homeomorphism where an injective mapping of the vertices of the pattern graph into vertices of the host graph is already given in the input instance is termed fixed-vertex subgraph homeomorphism. We show that fixed-vertex subgraph homeomorphism for a pattern graph on p vertices and a host graph on n vertices can be solved in time 2n−pnO(1) or in time 3n−pnO(1) and polynomial space. In effect, we obtain new non-trivial upper bounds on the time complexity of the problem of finding k vertex-disjoint paths and general subgraph homeomorphism."

abstract="Recently, great efforts have been dedicated to researches on the management of large-scale graph-based data, where node disjoint subgraph homeomorphism relation between graphs has been shown to be more suitable than (sub)graph isomorphism in many cases, especially in those cases where node skipping and node mismatching are desired. However, no efficient algorithm for node disjoint subgraph homeomorphism determination (ndSHD) has been available. In this paper, we propose two computationally efficient ndSHD algorithms based on state spaces searching with backtracking, which employ many heuristics to prune the search spaces. Experimental results on synthetic data sets show that the proposed algorithms are efficient, require relatively little time in most of cases, can scale to large or dense graphs, and can accommodate to more complex fuzzy matching cases.",

abstract="Efficient management of networks requires that the shortest route from one point (node) to another is known; this is termed the shortest path. It is often necessary to be able to determine alternative routes through the network, in case any part of the shortest path is damaged or busy. The k-shortest paths represent an ordered list of the alternative routes available. Four algorithms were selected for more detailed study from over seventy papers written on this subject since the 1950's. These four were implemented in the `C' programming language and, on the basis of the results, an assessment was made of their relative performance.",

 abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for finding the K loopless paths that have the shortest lengths from one node to another node in a network. The significance of the new algorithm is that its computational upper bound increases only linearly with the value of K. Consequently, in general, the new algorithm is extremely efficient as compared with the algorithms proposed by Bock, Kantner, and Haynes [2], Pollack [7], [8], Clarke, Krikorian, and Rausan [3], Sakarovitch [9] and others. This paper first reviews the algorithms presently available for finding the K shortest loopless paths in terms of the computational effort and memory addresses they require. This is followed by the presentation of the new algorithm and its justification. Finally, the efficiency of the new algorithm is examined and compared with that of other algorithms.},
